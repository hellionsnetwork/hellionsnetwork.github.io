        <dt>Anonymous Forum For Transgender Students of Hollins</dt>
        <dd> Here it is, I finally made it. This is a forum created by 
        and for transgender students, a marginalized group in a very 
        toxic school environment. Please use this to post trans-related
        information, questions, and to connect with other transgender
        students. Please contact the mediators and website creator with any
         comments, suggestions, or questions at: <i>hellionsnetwork@gmail.com</i>.</em> </dd>
   <dl>
    <small>With help, I created a system of chatrooms on <i><a href="http://slack.com/">slack.com/</i> </a>which we can use to talk with each other in a more
    casual setting and more immediately. We can use this to replace social media apps and emails to keep
    each of us anonymous and informed. To join the workspace, click this link and provide an email that you
    feel comfortable with connecting to this site. It will ask you for a confirmation code which will appear 
    in your inbox. Once confirmed, you will be able to join the hellions network slate chatrooms! You can private
     message me here or with any other member. Please email me if you are having trouble. </small>

      <h3>Message from the website creator:</h3>
      <p>Hello and thank you for visiting my website. With the help of loved ones and the help of online resources,
     I've been able to provide a network for our transgender community here at Hollins and abroad. I created this website
     after coming to the conclusion that transgender students at Hollins not only need support and resources, but that 
 love and information provided in a way that reduces the risk of anyone being outted. I vow to make this place as safe as
     I possibly can while each of us struggle every day to make our homes a safe space. This is where you have the ability
     to speak your mind, ask questions, provide information, and love to our transgender community. Every type of trans 
     experience is welcome in this space. Every trans voice is welcome. Please contact me on the Live Chatroom (Slack) or
       by posting on either of the forums by addressing me as <b>Creator</b> and I will try to get back to you as soon as
     possible. Please use the live chatroom and the resources provided on this page for emergencies. I hope you enjoy your stay!</p>
